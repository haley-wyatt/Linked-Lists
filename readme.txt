This is a project from my data structures class at UNR. The point of the project is to design and implement linked lists by creating a simple to-do program.

Instructions to run code:
    The makefile is set-up to use the GNU c++ compiler
    In bash terminal run the following commands:
        make
        ./executable

Included files:
    driver.cpp
    makefile
    readme.txt
    linkedlist.cpp
    linkedlist.has
    listinterface.has
    node.h
    node.cpp
